A Magic: The Gathering(TM) life counter app for Android.

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/hal7df/proLIFErate/releases) to find binary builds for each version.

This app runs on the Qt libraries. It requires the [Ministro II app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.necessitas.ministro) from BogDan Vatra.

I do not own any rights to Magic: The Gathering, Android, or Qt. They are owned by Wizards of the Coast, Google, Inc., and Digia Plc. respectively.
